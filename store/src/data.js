      "While the 13-inch Spectre x360 isn’t without peers in both the Ultrabook and convertible computing categories, it’s HP’s convertible that is unrivaled when it comes to value. Apple’s similarly configured MacBook Pro 13-inch with Touch Bar, for example, retails for $1,999 but only comes with half the RAM and no touchscreen, while Dell’s touch-enabled XPS 13 notebook only comes with a QHD+ resolution display and retails for $1,949 when configured with similar options to our Spectre review unit. Neither notebooks come with a 360-degree hinge, so you won’t be able to convert the MacBook or XPS into a tablet on the go.",

      "Huawei has done it again, and its latest laptop has topped our best laptops list for 2019. As with last year's Huawei MateBook X Pro, the MateBook 13 comes with some of the latest components, including a discrete Nvidia MX150 graphics card, and a gorgeous lightweight design, that you'd expect to find on a much more expensive laptop. The fact that the MateBook 13 offer so much, yet comes with an impressively low price – compared to its Ultrabook competitors, like the XPS 13 below – makes it our choice for the best laptop money can buy right now.

The Acer Predator Helios 300 packs some excellent components, such as a new 8th generation 6-core Intel Core i7 processor, Nvidia GTX 1060 graphics card and 16GB of RAM.",

This is a laptop that finally delivers on what Microsoft set out to do with the original: a pure, powerful Windows 10 laptop experience.",

    info:
      "The Asus ROG Zephyrus S GX701 is the best gaming laptop of 2019 thanks to its powerful components that include a 6-core Intel processor, and the latest RTX 2080 graphics from Nvidia. Not only is this a brilliant performer, but it's also impressively thin and light as well (by gaming laptop standards). Asus' Zephyrus laptops have constantly pushed the boundaries of what gaming laptops can do, and this new model for 2019 is no difference, which is why it has made it straight onto our best laptops list. It's available to pre-order now, but be warned: this is a very expensive laptop. If you're looking for something a bit more affordable, check out the Acer Predator Helios 300 later on in this list.",

This premium Ultrabook has a beautiful touchscreen 4K display, an integrated Nvidia GeForce GTX 960M graphics card and performs excellently with its Core i7 processor. On the battery side of things, it doesn’t perform as well as the HP ultrabooks below. Aside from that, the XPS 15 Touch is a fantastic laptop that’ll make a great desktop replacement.",
